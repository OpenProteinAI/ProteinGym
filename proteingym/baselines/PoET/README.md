# PoET: A generative model of protein families as sequences-of-sequences

Contains the inference code for ["PoET: A generative model of protein families as sequences-of-sequences"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06156), a state-of-the-art protein language model for variant effect prediction and conditional sequence generation.

## Environment Setup

1. Have `conda` installed
1. Run `make create_conda_env`. This will create a conda environment named `poet`.
1. Run `make download_model` to download the model (~400MB). The model will be located at `data/poet.ckpt`. Please note the [license](#License).
